                How many roads must a man walk down
                Before you call him a man?
                How many seas must a white dove sail
                Before she sleeps in the sand?
                Yes, 'n' how many times must the cannon balls fly
                Before they're forever banned?
                The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
                The answer is blowin' in the wind
                Yes, 'n' how many years can a mountain exist
                Before it's washed to the sea?
                Yes, 'n' how many years can some people exist
                Before they're allowed to be free?
                Yes, 'n' how many times can a man turn his head
                And pretend that he just doesn't see?
                The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
                The answer is blowin' in the wind
                Yes, 'n' how many times must a man look up
                Before he can see the sky?
                Yes, 'n' how many ears must one man have
                Before he can hear people cry?
                Yes, 'n' how many deaths will it take till he knows
                That too many people have died?
                The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
                The answer is blowin' in the wind
